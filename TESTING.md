## For everyone

### Open the calendar, it should be showing the current month.

- Open the webpage, it shows the calendar, and verify the month select is displaying the current month (Now it is in Feb by the time of testing);

### Go to October 2024. Observe:

#### A grid of 5 rows x 7 columns.

- Navigate the calendar to October 2024, confirm the date grid is 5 rows X 7 columns

#### The first row contains Tuesday October 1 - Saturday October 5. Sunday and Monday are either labelled for September 29/30 or are blank.

- Confirming Sunday and Monday are blank followed by the first row contains Tuesday October 1 - Saturday 5.
- May be a unit test, using index to check the first 7 item

#### The last row contains Sunday October 27 - Thursday October 31. Friday and Saturday are either labelled for November or are blank.

- Requirements will be confirmed by verifying the last row contains Sunday October 27 - Thursday October 31 followed by Friday and Saturday are blank.

#### October 8th: Ada Lovelace Day.

- Verifying the second Tuesday contains a title - Ada Lovelace Day
- Unit tests in

#### October 25th: World Lemur Day.

- Verifying the last Friday contains a title - World Lemur Day
- Unit tests in

### On the web page, open October 2020. Observe:

#### October 13th: Ada Lovelace Day.

- Unit tests in

#### October 30th: World Lemur Day.

- Unit tests in

### On the web page, open May 2030. Observe:

#### May 11th: International Binturong Day.

- Unit tests in

### The following months start and end on these dates, and do not have extra days or padding boxes outside of the weeks they're meant to cover:

#### 2024-12: Sunday (no empty days before) - Tuesday (4 empty days after).

#### 2025-02: Saturday (6 days before) - Friday (1 empty day after).

#### 2025-05: Thursday (4 empty days before) - Saturday (no empty days after).

#### 2026-02: Sunday (no empty days before) - Saturday (no empty days after).

### Functioning previous and next buttons including at the end-points of the month+year selector (if it has ends).

#### If there are end-points to the month+year selector, the previous and next buttons must work flawlessly when going beyond that limit. The UI must not e.g. show an empty string, "undefined", "null", "NaN" or similar if the "current month" or "current year" is displayed anywhere in the UI. The calendar days must be correctly shown.

### A usable way of jumping to a month+year.

### UI is generated by DOM manipulation, and day generation is dynamic. Everything would work if arbitrary additional days were added to the data file.

### The website must score 100 for accessibility in Lighthouse

### Unit tests must be written for at least one non-trivial function

- Unit tests in

## For groups of at least 2

### Run the supplied file with node, generates a file named days.ics. Import that file into a Google Calendar (see instructions above). Verify the same dates as in the web UI.

### The events in the calendar must be whole-day events, and not have a start/end time.

### Logic for calculating dates must be shared between the web generator and the iCal generator.
